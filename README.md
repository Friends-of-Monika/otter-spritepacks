# 📦 Otter Spritepack Archive

Friends of Monika have found and picked up content Otter left behind, deleting
their GitHub account and Google Drive.

These spritepacks are preserved as is, only JSON files have been prettified
automatically to make them all look uniform and valid.

## ❓ Where do I download the spritepacks?

Head over to [latest release][1] and scroll down to the Assets section. You'll
see a bunch of spritepack .zip files.

## 📥 How do I install them?

Download those you are interested in, open folders containing stuff you want
(you should end up in a folder that has `game` and `characters` folders), then
drag and drop *both* folders into the same folder where `DDLC.exe` file is along
with folders `game`, `log` and alike.
